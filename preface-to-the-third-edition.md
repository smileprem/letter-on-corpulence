# PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION

The second edition of this pamphlet (consisting of 1,500 copies) being exhausted, and the result being very gratifying to my mind, in the large amount of satisfaction and benefit which I am able to report from evidence of others _(beyond my most sanguine expectations)_, considering the hitherto limited circulation, I have felt impelled to publish, advertise, and sell this third edition, at cost price, which I am informed must be sixpence a copy. If this small charge, however, should yield any profit, I shall devote it to the Printer's Pension Society, or some other benevolent institution; but I have no such expectation, or would very gladly reduce the charge at starting.

The first and second editions were no very serious expense to me, scarcely three pence a copy, but the circulation of them, and the correspondence involved, have cost me far more; yet, I saw no way of securing my motives from misconception except by gratuitously presenting the pamphlet to the public.

The truthful tale has, however, made its way into a large circle of sufferers with marvelous effect; and I can now believe the public will rather prefer to purchase the third edition at a reasonable charge than be under obligation to me for a gratuitous supply. I therefore humbly trust, and fully believe, that by this means the useful knowledge will be distributed twenty-fold to the benefit of suffering humanity, which, indeed, is my sole object.
